# Administrator Guide: Complete System Setup

This guide is intended for system administrators who need to set up the entire Best Tickets system, including the database, server, and admin software.

## Prerequisites

- Server
- MySQL Server 5.7+ or compatible
- .NET 6.0 SDK and Runtime
- .NET 9.0 SDK and Runtime
- Python 3.9+ with pip
- Administrative privileges on all systems
- Network connectivity between all components

## Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Install MySQL Server**:
   - Download MySQL from [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   - Follow the installer instructions for your operating system
   - Set a secure root password during installation

2. **Create Database and User**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE best_tickets CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'best_tickets_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong-password-here';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON best_tickets.* TO 'best_tickets_user'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **Configure MySQL Settings**:
   - Edit the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`)
   - Ensure the server accepts remote connections if needed:
     ```
     bind-address = 0.0.0.0
     ```
   - Adjust other performance parameters as needed
   - Restart MySQL service

4. **Secure the MySQL Installation**:
   - Run the MySQL secure installation script
   ```bash
   mysql_secure_installation
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to secure your MySQL installation

## Step 2: Ticket Server Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jere344/best-tickets.git
   cd best-tickets/ticket-server
   ```

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Windows:
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Open `main.py` and update the DATABASE_URI variable with your database connection details:
   ```python
   DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://root:your-password-here@localhost:3306/best-tickets'
   # or for the school server:
   # DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://dev-2230460:[pass]@sql.decinfo-cchic.ca:33306/a24_e80_projetagile_prod_2230460'
   ```

6. **Configure Server Network Settings**:
   - Open `main.py` and locate the waitress.serve() function near the bottom of the file
   - Update the host parameter to specify which network interface to listen on:
   ```python
   waitress.serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=PORT, threads=4)  # Listen on all interfaces
   # or
   waitress.serve(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=PORT, threads=4)  # Listen only on localhost
   # or 
   waitress.serve(app, host='your.server.ip.address', port=PORT, threads=4)  # Listen on specific IP
   ```
   - Note: Using '0.0.0.0' allows connections from any network interface, which is typically needed for production

7. **Initialize the Database**:
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running
   - Create an empty database if it doesn't exist:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `best_tickets` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   ```
   - Navigate to the admin-software directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../admin-software
   ```
   - Replace the connection strings in the `appsettings.json` file with your MySQL server details:
   ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
         "ReleaseConnection": "Server=votre-serveur-mysql;Port=3306;Database=best_tickets;Uid=votre-nom-utilisateur;Pwd=votre-mot-de-passe",
         "DefaultConnection": "Server=sql.decinfo-cchic.ca;Port=33306;Database=a24_e80_projetagile_prod_2230460;Uid=dev-2230460;Pwd=[mot-de-passe]",
         "Test": ""
      }
    }
    ```
    * If you are building in Release mode, use the ReleaseConnection string
    * If you are using the school server, use the DefaultConnection string
    * When in doubt, just edit both
   - Install the Entity Framework Core CLI tools if not already installed:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
   ```
   - Apply the database migrations to create all tables and schema:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --connection "Server=localhost;Database=best_tickets;User=best_tickets_user;Password=strong-password-here;"
   ```
   - This will create all necessary database tables and relationships using the migrations defined in the admin panel project

8. **Test the Server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The server should start and be accessible at http://your-server-ip:your-port
   You should see a message indicating "Parking Ticket Server Starting" and "Waitress server running..."

9. (optional) **Configure as a Service**:
   - Windows: Use NSSM or create a Windows Service
   - Linux: Create a systemd service file
     
     ```ini
     # /etc/systemd/system/best-tickets-server.service
     [Unit]
     Description=Best Tickets API Server
     After=network.target mysql.service
     
     [Service]
     User=ubuntu
     WorkingDirectory=/path/to/best-tickets/ticket-server
     ExecStart=/path/to/best-tickets/ticket-server/venv/bin/python main.py
     Restart=always
     RestartSec=5
     Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
     
     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```
     
     Then enable and start the service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable best-tickets-server
     sudo systemctl start best-tickets-server
     ```

10. **Configure Firewall**:
   - Allow incoming connections on the server port (default: 5000)
   - Windows:
     ```cmd
     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Best Tickets Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
     ```
   - Linux (UFW):
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp
     ```

## Step 3: Admin Software Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Windows 10/11 with .NET 6.0 Runtime installed
   - Network connectivity to the database and server

2. **Installation**:
   - Navigate to the admin-software directory
   - Build or obtain the admin software installation package
     ```bash
     dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
     ```
   - Copy the published files to the administrator's computer

3. **Configuration**:
   - Edit the `appsettings.json` file:
     ```json
     {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
         "ReleaseConnection": "Server=your-mysql-server;Port=3306;Database=best_tickets;Uid=your-username;Pwd=your-password",
         "DefaultConnection": "Server=sql.decinfo-cchic.ca;Port=33306;Database=a24_e80_projetagile_prod_2230460;Uid=dev-2230460;Pwd=[password]",
         "Test": ""
       }
     }
     ```
   - If building in Release mode, use the ReleaseConnection string
   - If using the school server, use the DefaultConnection string
   > When in doubt, just edit both

4. **First Launch and Initialization**:
   - Run the admin software (`admintickets.exe`)
   - Login with the default credentials:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin
   - **IMPORTANT**: Immediately change the default password

5. **Configure your first Hospital in the system**:
   - Go to "Hospitals" section
   - Click "Add New Hospital"

   - Set a secure gateway password for the hospital (write this down, you'll need it for gate setup)

6. **Create Administrator Accounts**:
   - Go to the "Admin" section
   - Create new administrator accounts
   - For each new account, copy the temporary password and provide it to the user
   - Instruct users to change their password on first login
      -> Go to "Profile" with the profile icon in the top right corner
      -> fill in the "Old Password" field with the temporary password
      -> fill in the "New Password" field with the new password
      -> fill in the "Confirm Password" field with the new password
      -> click on the "Save" button

7. **Configure System Settings**:
   - Set up tax rates
   - Configure price brackets
   - Set up subscription tiers
   - Configure discount codes if needed

## Step 4: System Testing

1. **Verify Database Connectivity**:

   - Test creating, updating, and deleting records

2. **Test API Server Functionality**:
   - Verify the server is running
   - Test API endpoints using a tool like Postman
   - Verify authentication is working
  
   Test: Create a Ticket (Valid Credentials)
   ðŸ“Œ **Expected:** Returns a JSON object with a new ticket and hospital details.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://[server-address:port]/create_ticket ^
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
      -d "{ \"hospital_id\": [id], \"password\": \"[correct-password]\" }"
   ```

3. **Validate Hospital Configuration**:
